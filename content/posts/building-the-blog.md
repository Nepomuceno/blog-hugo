## Choosing the blog platform

Every time that I try to stat bloggin I always get stuck on the building the blog effort. I think I honestly started a least 4 blogs and stopped just on the fact that I havent choosen the blog engine. I passed to the most diferent kind of blogs. I used [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) [jerkyll]() among others.

One thing that I had certain it was that I wanted something that would be using [markdown](). There has been some time that I have been using markdown to take all my notes and I got really confortable with it, it remembers me a bit the times of Uni and using [Tex]() but only much simples to write.

With this recomendation I asked [Ben](blog.bencoleman.co.uk) which blog engine he was using and he introduced me to  [Hexo](https://hexo.io/), It is awesome and I honestly can't recomend it highly enough. It has been working really well for me and if you like markdown I honestly suggest you to go for it to. not only that but you can do most of the things from the command line with the [hexo-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hexo-cli).
