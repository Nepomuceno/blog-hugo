Changing a company culture it is something that takes time even for small companies imagine to change the culture of a company with more than 100,000 employees.

I have always been an admirer of Microsoft from the outside but this last week from inside Microsoft gave me the chance to admire even more the transformation and the doer culture that have been created inside the company.

Las week I was in one of the largest internal company hackathon in the world we had almost 25k hackers and more than 5,000 projects this numbers are not only astonishing but show all the effortt and incentive that the company put in this.

## Getting to the hack

My case for whows how Microsoft has been dedicated to creating this culture, since was not even supposed to be there.

We had another internal hack in UK, where everyone from my department was invited. We had 2 days in which they could get together to hack in any project they though was interesting the 2 projects that win were going to be selected to participate in the company wide hack and the team of this projects would be flew over to seattle to participate in the hack.

My team was not the winner but My coleague [Ahmed](https://twitter.com/AhmElmahdey) had holidas schedule already and couldn't reschedule so he asked for me to go in his place to help the team. So I joined [Simi](https://twitter.com/similola) and the company flew me over with all expenses paid from London to Seattle so I could participate in a hack.

## The hack days

The hack started on a Monday (2018-07-23) and would go until Wednesday and we would have time to submit our project and just after that.

### The facilities

If you havent been to the Microsoft Campus before and live in Seattle or around I strongly suggest you to go. The place it is incredible brething technology everything works so well, there are busses that take you everywhere but I really like to walk around, if you are an empoyee you can sit for some time in the cefeteria and hear some of the most interesting technologies conversations that you would expect. Last time there just for a sample, last time that I was there I heard about compile optimizations for C# and how to improve extensions in vscode.
